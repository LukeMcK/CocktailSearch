# CocktailSearch

<br> This project uses the api found at https://www.thecocktaildb.com/ in order to retrieve objects and then render them to the page using React. 
<br> The user is able to search all the cocktails found within the cocktail database and click on each rendered card to direct them to a list of recipes on Google.
